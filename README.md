# Crisp

This is a TUI project of mine for organizing and keeping track of tasks I have for home development ideas. Go is a language I am wanted to become more familiar with, and I thought this would be a great project for that.

## Project Status

TUI has been built, but is in early development and still has many more features and aesthetic details yet to be added.

## Upcoming Features

- Delete task functionality
- Some sort of ASCI art for Crisp logo
- Due dates
- Task priorities
